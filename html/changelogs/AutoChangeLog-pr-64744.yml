changes: 
  - balance: "Hand mining weak turfs (i.e. snow) is now affected by mining level (so legendary would take 7.5 seconds instead of 15)"
  - qol: "Multiple people can now attempt to manually mine the same mineral turf"
  - qol: "If you fail to manually mine a turf you can try again immediately instead of having to wait for the cooldown to end"
  - bugfix: "You can no longer mine a snow turf by hand if you're already doing it"
  - code_imp: "Uses variables and time defines for mining speeds instead of deciseconds and magic numbers"
